# Coin Drop

Android version available now [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.coindrop)!

**Coin Drop** is an arcade turn-based puzzle strategy game, inspired by one of Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates' mini games: Treasure Drop.

The original game only had coins and was exclusively two player versus, but here we added some twists to spice things up... and a single player mode!

In the board you can find:

- ![coin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11984042/222922526-23c7c0bf-e5be-4ec5-89dc-bbb69890a426.png) Coins: gives you points when it falls into a score slot. Can combine with another coin in the air to multiply its value.
- ![bomb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11984042/222922534-bdb7b9e0-795b-45e3-b40b-dd169368b275.png) Bombs: destroys coins and power ups when falling. It's timer ticks whenever it touches a switch head, and explodes after 3 ticks (or when a round ends). It's explosion can destroy a switch or a score slot.
- ![coin_bag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11984042/222922553-9497149d-04ac-42c9-93b6-5aeae4f144f6.png) Coin bags: spawns coins in 5 random slots.
- ![extra_coins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11984042/222922564-78a86983-9699-4fe5-b151-288433457209.png) Extra coins: gives you 3 more coins for this round (single player only).
- ![switch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11984042/222922540-b4a7043b-e27c-4164-9dcf-30d0e5e15b70.png) Switches: holds coins and bombs in the upper part, rotates when something touches the bottom part.

Get as many points as you can, while reaching the required score each round to pass to the next one. Score slots values will change every round.

Deciding whether a bomb destroys a switch or a score slot is up to you... kind of?
